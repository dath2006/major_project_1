Hello everyone,
This is my first full stack project. In this i have used npm packages such as :
=> passport - for authentication
=> cloudinary - for image storing
=> mongoose-session - for storing sessional data
=> mongo-atlas - for database
And render for free hosting

This project is like clone to Airbnb. (Beginnner Level).
I have also made it responsive so feel free to open in any devices.
As this is not the final version since it could have some styling issue or some bugs and i will definetly fix these in upcomming commits.

Hosted Link - [Click ME](https://major-project-1-6qm4.onrender.com/listings) - Please have patience since it is free hosting

I have used MVC for arranging codes and all.

Hope every one like this. 
                   Thank You.
