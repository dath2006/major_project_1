    <p>Thank you for using Airbnb!</p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>These Terms of Service for European Users (“Terms”) are a binding legal agreement between you and Airbnb that govern your right to use the websites, applications, and other offerings from Airbnb (collectively, the “Airbnb Platform”). When used in these Terms, “Airbnb,” “we,” “us,” or “our” refers to the Airbnb entity set out on Schedule 1 with whom you are contracting.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The Airbnb Platform offers an online venue that enables users (“Members”) to publish, offer, search for, and book services. Members who publish and offer services are “Hosts” and Members who search for, book, or use services are “Guests.” Hosts offer accommodations (“Accommodations”), activities, excursions and events (“Experiences”), and a variety of travel and other services (collectively, “Host Services,” and each Host Service offering, a “Listing”). As the provider of the Airbnb Platform, Airbnb does not own, control, offer or manage any Listings, Host Services, or tourism services. Airbnb is not a party to the contracts entered into directly between Hosts and Guests, nor is Airbnb a real estate broker, travel agency, insurer or an organiser or retailer of travel packages under Directive (EU) 2015/2302. Airbnb is not acting as an agent in any capacity for any Member, except as specified in the Payments Terms of Service (“Payment Terms”). To learn more about Airbnb’s role see Section 17.</p>
    <br>
    <p>We maintain other terms and policies that supplement these Terms like our Privacy Policy, which describes our collection and use of personal data, and our Payments Terms, which govern any payment services provided to Members by the Airbnb payment entities (collectively "Airbnb Payments").</p>

    <p>Guest Terms
        1. Searching and Booking on Airbnb.
        1.1 Searching.
        You can search for Host Services by using criteria like the type of Host Service, type of listing, travel destination, travel dates, and number of guests. You can also use filters to refine your search results. Search results are based on their relevance to your search and other criteria. Relevance considers factors like price, availability, reviews, customer service and cancellation history, popularity, previous trips and saved Listings, Host requirements (e.g. minimum or maximum nights), and more. Learn more about search results in Section 5.3 and in our Help Center.
        
        1.2 Booking.
        When you book a Listing, you are agreeing to pay all charges for your booking including the Listing price, applicable fees like Airbnb’s service fee, offline fees, taxes and any other items identified during checkout (collectively, “Total Price”). If you choose to pay using a currency that differs from the currency set by the Host for their Listing, the price displayed to you is based on a currency conversion rate determined by us. When you receive the booking confirmation, a contract for Host Services (a "Reservation") is formed directly between you and the Host. In addition to these Terms, you will be subject to, and responsible for complying with, all terms of the Reservation, including without limitation, the cancellation policy and any other rules, standards, policies, or requirements identified in the Listing or during checkout that apply to the Reservation. It is your responsibility to read and understand these rules, standards, policies, and requirements prior to booking a Listing. Be aware that some Hosts work with a co-host or as part of a team to provide their Host Services.
        
        1.3 Accommodation Reservations.
        An Accommodation Reservation is a limited license to enter, occupy and use the Accommodation. The Host retains the right to re-enter the Accommodation during your stay, to the extent: (i) it is reasonably necessary, (ii) permitted by your contract with the Host, and (iii) permitted by applicable law. If you stay past checkout, the Host has the right to make you leave in a manner permitted by applicable law, including by imposing reasonable overstay penalties. You may not exceed the maximum number of allowed Guests.
        
        1.4 Reservations for Experiences and Other Host Services.
        An Experience or other Host Service Reservation entitles you to participate in, attend, or use that Experience or Host Service. You are responsible for confirming that you, and anyone you invite, meet minimum age, proficiency, fitness or other requirements. You are responsible for informing the Host of any medical or physical conditions, or other circumstances that may impact your ability to participate, attend or use the Experience or Host Service. Except where expressly authorized, you may not allow any person to join an Experience or other Host Service unless they are included as an additional guest during the booking process.
        
        2. Cancellations, Reservation Issues, Refunds and Booking Modifications.
        2.1 Cancellations, Reservation Issues, and Refunds.
        In general, if you cancel a Reservation, the amount refunded to you is determined by the cancellation policy that applies to that Reservation. But, in certain situations, other policies may take precedence and determine what amount is refunded to you. If something outside your control requires you to cancel a Reservation, you may be entitled to a partial or full refund under our Major Disruptive Events Policy. If the Host cancels, or you experience a Reservation Issue (as defined in our Rebooking and Refund Policy), you may be entitled to rebooking assistance or a partial or full refund under our Rebooking and Refund Policy. Different policies apply to certain categories of Listings; for example, Experiences Reservations are governed by the Experiences Guest Refund Policy. See each Additional Legal Term or Policy for details about what is covered, and what refund applies in each situation. You may appeal a decision by Airbnb by contacting our customer service.
        
        2.2 Booking Modifications.
        Hosts and Guests are responsible for any booking modifications they agree to make via the Airbnb Platform or direct Airbnb customer service to make on their behalf ("Booking Modifications"), and agree to pay any additional amounts, fees or taxes associated with any Booking Modification.
        
        3. Your Responsibilities.
        You are responsible for your own acts and omissions and are also responsible for the acts and omissions of anyone you invite to join or provide access to any Accommodation, all areas and facilities where the Accommodation is located that the Host and Guest are legally entitled to use in connection with the Accommodation (“Common Areas”), or any Experience or other Host Service. For example, this means: (i) you are responsible for leaving an Accommodation (and related personal property) or Common Areas in the condition it was in when you arrived, (ii) you are responsible for paying all reasonable Damage Claim amounts, and (iii) you must act with integrity, treat others with respect and comply with applicable laws at all times. If you are booking for an additional guest who is a minor or if you bring a minor to a Host Service, you must be legally authorized to act on behalf of the minor and you are solely responsible for the supervision of that minor.
        
        Host Terms
        4. Hosting on Airbnb.
        4.1 Host.
        As a Host, Airbnb offers you the right to use the Airbnb Platform in accordance with these Terms to share your Accommodation, Experience, or other Host Service with our vibrant community of Guests - and earn money doing it. It’s easy to create a Listing and you are in control of how you host - set your price, availability, and rules for each Listing. If you are a Business Host according to Section 26 additional terms apply.
        
        4.2 Contracting with Guests.
        When you accept a booking request, or receive a booking confirmation through the Airbnb Platform, you are entering into a contract directly with the Guest, and are responsible for delivering the Host Service under the terms and at the price specified in your Listing. You are also agreeing to pay applicable fees like Airbnb’s service fee (and applicable guest taxes) for each booking. Airbnb Payments will deduct amounts you owe from your payout unless we and you agree to a different method. Any terms or conditions that you include in any supplement contract with Guests must: (i) be consistent with these Terms, our Additional Legal Terms, Policies, and the information provided in your Listing, and (ii) be prominently disclosed in your Listing description.
        
        4.3 Independence of Hosts.
        Your relationship with Airbnb is that of an independent individual or entity and not an employee, agent, joint venturer or partner of Airbnb, except that Airbnb Payments acts as a payment collection agent as described in the Payments Terms. Airbnb does not direct or control your Host Service and you understand that you have complete discretion whether and when to provide Host Services and at what price and on what terms to offer them.
        
        5. Managing Your Listing.
        5.1 Creating and Managing Your Listing.
        The Airbnb Platform provides tools that make it easy for you to set up and manage a Listing. Your Listing must include complete and accurate information about your Host Service, your price, other charges like cleaning fees, resort fees, offline fees, and any rules or requirements that apply to your Guests or Listing. You are responsible for your acts and omissions as well as for keeping your Listing information (including calendar availability) and content (like photos) up-to-date and accurate at all times. You are responsible for obtaining appropriate insurance for your Host Services and we suggest you carefully review policy terms and conditions like coverage details and exclusions. You may only maintain one Listing per Accommodation, but may have multiple Listings for a single property if it has multiple places to stay. Any offer of an Experience is subject to our Additional Terms for Experience Hosts.
        
        5.2 Know Your Legal Obligations.
        You are responsible for understanding and complying with any laws, rules, regulations and contracts with third parties that apply to your Listing or Host Services. For example: Some landlords and leases, or homeowner and condominium association rules, restrict or prohibit subletting, short-term rentals and/or longer-term stays. Some cities have zoning or other laws that restrict the short-term rental of residential properties. Some jurisdictions require Hosts to register, get a permit, or obtain a license before providing certain Host Services (such as short-term rentals, longer-term stays, preparing food, serving alcohol for sale, guiding tours or operating a vehicle). In some places, the Host Services you want to offer may be prohibited altogether. Some jurisdictions require that you register Guests who stay at your Accommodation. Some jurisdictions have laws that create tenancy rights for Guests and additional obligations for Hosts. For example, some places have landlord-tenant, rent control, and eviction laws that may apply to longer stays. Check your local rules to learn what rules apply to the Host Services you plan to offer. Information we provide regarding legal requirements is for informational purposes only and you should independently confirm your obligations. You are responsible for handling and using personal data of Guests and others in compliance with applicable privacy laws and these Terms, including our Host Privacy Standards. If you have questions about how local laws apply you should always seek legal advice.
        
        5.3 Search Results.
        The ranking and display of Listings in search results on the Airbnb Platform depends on a variety of factors, including these main parameters:
        
        Guest search parameters (e.g. number of Guests, destination, time and duration of the trip, price range),
        Listing characteristics (e.g. location, price, calendar availability, number and quality of images, reviews, ratings and other quality signals, type or category of Host Service, host status, length of time the Listing has been live on the Airbnb Platform, Guest engagement and popularity),
        Guest experience (e.g. customer service and cancellation history of the Host, ease of booking),
        Host and Listing requirements (e.g. minimum or maximum nights, booking cut-off time), and
        Guest preferences and history (e.g. previous trips, viewed and saved Listings, location from where the Guest is searching).
        Search results may be different on our mobile application than on our website, and may also differ in the map view. Airbnb may allow Hosts to promote their Listings in search or elsewhere on the Airbnb Platform by paying an additional fee. More information about the factors that determine how your Listing appears in search results, our current promotional programs (if any) and how we identify promoted Content can be found in our Help Center.
        
        5.4 Your Responsibilities.
        You are responsible for your own acts and omissions and are also responsible for the acts and omissions of anyone you allow to participate in providing your Host Services. You are responsible for setting your price and establishing rules and requirements for your Listing. You must describe any and all fees and charges in your Listing description and may not collect any additional fees or charges outside the Airbnb Platform except those expressly authorized by our Offline Fee Policy. Do not encourage Guests to create third-party accounts, submit reviews, provide their contact information, or take other actions outside the Airbnb Platform in violation of our Off-Platform Policy.
        
        5.5 Hosting as a Team or Organization.
        If you work with a co-host or host as part of a team, business or other organization, you are responsible and liable as a Host under these Terms for the acts and omissions of each entity and individual who participates with you in providing Host services for each of your listings and you are required to inform personnel engaged by you to deliver any Host Services of your obligations under these Terms. If you accept terms or enter into contracts, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to enter into contracts for and bind your team, business or other organization, and that each entity you use is in good standing under the laws of the place where it is established. If you perform other functions, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to perform those functions. If you instruct Airbnb to transfer a portion of your payout to a co-host or other Hosts, or send payments to someone else, you must be authorized to do so, and are responsible and liable for the payment amounts and accuracy of any payout information you provide.
        
        6. Cancellations, Reservation Issues, and Booking Modifications.
        6.1 Cancellations and Reservation Issues.
        In general, if a Guest cancels a Reservation, the amount paid to you is determined by the cancellation policy that applies to that Reservation. As a host, you should not cancel on a Guest without a valid reason under our Major Disruptive Events Policy or applicable law. If you cancel on a Guest without such a valid reason, we may impose a cancellation fee and other consequences. If: (i) a Guest experiences a Reservation Issue (as defined by the Rebooking and Refund Policy), (ii) a Major Disruptive Event arises, or (iii) a Reservation is canceled under Section 13 of these Terms, the amount you are paid will be reduced by the amount we refund or otherwise provide to the Guest, and by any other reasonable costs we incur as a result of the cancellation. If a Guest receives a refund after you have already been paid, or the amount of the refund and other costs incurred by Airbnb exceeds your payout, Airbnb (via Airbnb Payments) may recover that amount from you, including by deducting the refund against your future payouts. You agree that Airbnb’s Rebooking and Refund Policy, Major Disruptive Events Policy, and these Terms preempt the cancellation policy you set in situations where they allow for the cancellation of a Reservation and/or the issuance of refunds to Guests. If we reasonably expect to provide a refund to a Guest under one of these policies, we may delay release of any payout for that Reservation until a refund decision is made. If you Host an Experience please note that the Experience Cancellation Policy, Experiences Guest Refund Policy and different cancellation fees and consequences apply to your Reservations. See each Policy for details about what is covered, and what your payout will be in each situation. You may appeal a decision by Airbnb by contacting our customer service.
        
        6.2 Booking Modifications.
        Hosts and Guests are responsible for any Booking Modifications they agree to make via the Airbnb Platform or direct Airbnb customer service to make on their behalf, and agree to pay any additional amounts, fees or taxes associated with a Booking Modification.
        
        7. Taxes.
        7.1 Host Taxes.
        As a Host, you are responsible for determining and fulfilling your obligations under applicable laws to report, collect, remit or include in your price any applicable VAT or other indirect taxes, occupancy taxes, tourist, income or other taxes ("Taxes").
        
        7.2 Collection and Remittance by Airbnb.
        In jurisdictions where Airbnb facilitates the collection and/or remittance of Taxes on behalf of Hosts, you instruct and authorize Airbnb to collect Taxes on your behalf, and/or to remit such Taxes to the relevant Tax authority. Any Taxes that are collected and/or remitted by Airbnb are identified to Members on their transaction records, as applicable. Airbnb may seek additional amounts from Members (including by deducting such amounts from future payouts) in the event that the Taxes collected and/or remitted are insufficient to fully discharge that Members’ tax obligations, and you agree that your sole remedy for Taxes collected by Airbnb is a refund from the applicable Tax authority. You acknowledge and agree that we retain the right, with prior notice to affected Members, to cease the collection and remittance of Taxes in any jurisdiction for any reason.
        
        7.3 Tax Information.
        In certain jurisdictions, Tax regulations may require that we collect and/or report Tax information about you, or withhold Taxes from payouts to you, or both. If you fail to provide us with documentation that we determine to be sufficient to support any such obligation to withhold Taxes from payouts to you, we may withhold payouts up to the amount as required by law, until sufficient documentation is provided. You agree that Airbnb may issue on your behalf invoices or similar documentation for VAT, GST, consumption or other Taxes for your Host Services to facilitate accurate tax reporting.
